Khalid has just logged onto a host that he and his team use as a testing host for many different purposes, it’s off their corporate network but has access to lots of resources in network.
The host is used as a dumping ground for a lot of people at the company but it’s very useful, so no one has raised any issues.Little does Khalid know; the machine has been compromised and company information that should not have been on there has now been stolen –
it’s up to you to figure out what has happened and what data has been taken.
