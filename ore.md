Description
```
One of our technical partners are currently managing our AWS infrastructure. We requested the deployment of some technology into the cloud. The solution proposed was an EC2 instance hosting the Grafana application. Not too long after the EC2 was deployed the CPU usage ended up sitting at a continuous 98%+ for a process named "xmrig". Important Information Our organisation's office public facing IP is 86.5.206.121, upon the deployment of the application we carried out some basic vulnerability testing and maintenance.
